from nevow import rend
from nevow import tags as T

##  Let's start from the beginning (apart from the various imports):

##  We are provided 2 different classes, Person and Bookmark which contain some information (maybe built from a RDBMS 
##  or directly from an OODB).

##  Then the hard stuff begins (I'm not going to explain extensively how adaptation works since there's not enough room, 
##  but I'm going to give you just a fast overview of how objects and adapter relate to each other):

##  We need 2 different adapters since Person and Bookmark are not directly renderable and need some extra 
##  transformations. What we do here with PersonView and BookmarkView is to define a class that inherits from
##  Adapter and define a rend method.

##  What is Adapter? Basically it is a class that accepts an argument in the constructor which is the object that 
##  needs to be adapted to some other interface. Obviously the adapter will implement the interface we need (ie: inevow.
##  IRenderer).

##  Why do we need to implement IRenderer? An object that implements IRenderer is an object upon which a rend() method
##  can be called safely. Since Nevow rendering pipeline uses rend() to serialize objects to html (remember that html tags 
##  are objects too in Nevow) we need to implement that interface, which is built-in. The adapters we wrote, directly 
##  implement IRenderer thus we can use them inside the rendering pipeline. Also each adapter holds a reference to the 
##  corresponding object in self.original.

##  Then 2 interesting lines:

##  registerAdapter(PersonView, Person, inevow.IRenderer)
##  registerAdapter(BookmarkView, Bookmark, inevow.IRenderer)

##  Basically we are registering in Nevow object space, that PersonView and BookmarkView are the adapters for classes/
##  objects Person and Bookmark to inevow.IRenderer. What does this mean? It means that when we will call inevow.
##  IRenderer() interface [later in the Page class] with an instance of Person or Bookmark as argument we will receive the 
##  right adapter as a result. Without these 2 lines, Nevow doesn't know anything about the way your objects are adapted 
##  or referenced by each other.

##  Then as usual we are creating a bunch of example objects in a list.

##  And, last, but not least, we wrote a Page class that uses stan to render the objects list.
