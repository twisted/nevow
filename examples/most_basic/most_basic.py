# This is a simple Root page object, the inevow.IResource interface
# tells us that it must implement 2 methods:
# locateChild and renderHTTP.
# locateChild is used to find children of the current page, it must return a 
# tuple of (page, remaining_segments)
# if there is no page, and you want to display a 404 page, you will need to return
# a None, () tuple.
