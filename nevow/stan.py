"""An s-expression-like syntax for expressing xml in pure python.

Stan tags allow you to build XML documents using Python. Stan tags
have special attributes that enable the developer to insert hooks in
the document for locating data and custom rendering.

Stan is a DOM, or Document Object Model, implemented using
basic Python types and functions called "flatteners". A flattener is
a function that knows how to turn an object of a specific type
into something that is closer to an HTML string. Stan differs
from the W3C DOM by not being as cumbersome and heavy
weight. Since the object model is built using simple python types
such as lists, strings, and dictionaries, the API is simpler and
constructing a DOM less cumbersome.

Stan also makes it convenient to build trees of XML in pure python
code. See nevow.stan.Tag for details, and nevow.tags for tag
prototypes for all of the XHTML element types.
