  # The `TWISTED` environment variable will give a (shell expression which
  # evaluates to) a Twisted requirement string which can be used to select a
  # version of Twisted to install.  This lets the test suite run against
  # multiple versions of Twisted.  As a cop out, this configuration only
  # actually tests the minimum supported version of Twisted, the latest release
  # of Twisted, and the master@HEAD version of Twisted.

  # For expediency, all combinations of `MODE` and `TWISTED` are not tested.
  # The "wheel" MODE is (arbitrarily) selected and all values of `TWISTED` are
  # exercised in that mode.
